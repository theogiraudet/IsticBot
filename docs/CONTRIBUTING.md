## :v: There are 2 main ways to contribute:

### :bug: Fix a bug
Do you think you would be able to fix a bug?
- If there is an open issue and no one is assigned feel free to claim it by commenting.
  Someone will assign you can begin working on it.
- If there is no issue open, open one using the bug report issue form and describe 
  the bug.
  We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you found.

### :sparkles: Add a new feature
Do you think you would be able to add a new feature?
- Looking for something to contribute? Find an open issue which is not assigned.
- Do you have a feature in mind that should be added and does not have an issue? 
  Open one using the Feature Request issue form and fill out the relevant information.

## :arrow_up: Make your update
Make your changes to the file(s) you'd like to update to solve an issue
or add a new feature.
You can change anything in the code, but please make sure to keep the code clean 
and well documented.


## :envelope_with_arrow:  Open a pull request
When you're done making changes,
and you'd like to propose them for review,
use the pull request template to open your PR (pull request).

* Make sure to not push in the `main` branch but in the`JDA` branch.

  pull request might not get approved and will be asked for modifications.
